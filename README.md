# Discord-AMC-Bot
Discord bot for recommending random problems from past AMC contests.

**I do not claim the rights to the AMC problems; they are publicly released on the AoPS website, found [here](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/AMC_Problems_and_Solutions). The code is released under the MIT License.**

# Syntax
Help command : `^help`

Recommend random AMC problem (sends contest name/year/problem as text along with problem) : `^gimme {10/12}`

# Installation
Download past AMC problems (bot assumes the files are organized as `amc/contest(10 or 12)/year/contest(A or B)/problem_no`)

Paste your bot token in a `TOKEN.txt` file, and you're ready to go!
